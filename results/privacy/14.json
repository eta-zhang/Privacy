This includes contracts, payroll, benefits, and workplace safety regulations.\n\n3. **Data Privacy Regulations:** Stay ahead of data privacy laws such as GDPR or CCPA, which govern how you collect, store, and manage personal data. Ensuring compliance can prevent hefty fines and build consumer trust.\n\nEach industry may have its own additional specific requirements, so it's wise to stay informed and consult with a legal expert, especially during the setup phase or when making significant changes to your business."
