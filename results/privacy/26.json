It's nice to see a familiar face here.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Work Topic Subtly:**\n   - \"Work has been quite hectic lately, especially with the flu season at the clinic.\"\n\n3. **Express Need for Support:**\n   - \"I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with the workload. Any suggestions on managing stress wouldn't go amiss.\"\n\n4. **Follow Michael's Reactions:**\n   - Observe his response and gauge his level of comfort and willingness to discuss the matter further.\n\n5. **Maintain Privacy and Boundaries:**\n   - Limit details to general work-related stress.\n   - Use vague or non-committal responses to challenging questions.\n   - Shift back to lighter subjects if the conversation becomes too personal.\n\n**Follow-Up Plan:**\n- If the advice is helpful, thank Michael and consider aligning for a follow-up discussion based on his available dates: 2023-12-01 or 2024-01-15.\n\nBy using this approach, Dr. Mariel can achieve the necessary support and advice while maintaining her privacy and professionalism."
