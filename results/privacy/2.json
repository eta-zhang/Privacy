Hassan has a high school diploma and prefers meeting on November 1 and December 1, 2023.\n\n**Disclosure Strategy:**\n\n**Phase 1: Initial Engagement**\n- **When:** Start the conversation on November 1, 2023, at a quiet time at the community center.\n- **What to Disclose:** Begin with general, non-sensitive information about career aspirations and daily life.\n- **Example:** \u201cI\u2019ve been working on a few freelance projects lately. How have things been on your end?\u201d\n\n**Phase 2: Gradual Disclosure**\n- **When:** Progress during the same meeting after building rapport.\n- **What to Disclose:** Share broad concerns about career stability while keeping details vague.\n- **Example:** \u201cLately, I\u2019ve been feeling a bit uncertain about where my career is heading. Do you ever feel worried about the future?\u201d\n- **Action:** Observe Hassan\u2019s body language and verbal cues to gauge his empathy and understanding.\n\n**Phase 3: Deeper Disclosure**\n- **When:** If Hassan responds empathetically and shows understanding.\n- **What to Disclose:** More specific concerns about financial stability and career direction.\n- **Example:** \u201cSometimes, it feels like no matter how hard I work, it's tough to make ends meet and ensure stability for my family. It can be really overwhelming at times.\u201d\n- **Action:** Ensure Hassan is comfortable and supportive before revealing more details.\n\nThis strategy allows Michael to seek emotional support and share his concerns in a measured and cautious way, aligning with his introverted nature and preference for gradual disclosure."
