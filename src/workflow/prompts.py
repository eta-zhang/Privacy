3. If the strategy is waiting for the human's response, you should talk about the topic without disclosing any sensitive information, and wait for the human's response. (e.g., I'm going to talk about the sex orientation.)
4. If the strategy is non-disclousre, your response should be abstract and non-committal, you can use some general words to avoid the disclosure, and you can change the topic. (e.g., I'm earning enough to support my family comfortably, let's talk about the travel and enjoy life.)

1. If the human respond positively, you can share more specific information based on the strategy. (e.g., I'm earning $70,000 per year, and I'm a software engineer.)
